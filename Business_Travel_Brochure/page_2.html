                        <h2>COLLECTIVE VALUES AND COMMUNICATION</h2>
                        Japan also has an extensive subculture, some of which have had their interest wane.
                        Some of Japan's subcultures are the &quot;Kogal&quot;, &quot;Itasha&quot; and &quot;Cosplay&quot; cultures. Itasha is
                        a fad whereby those involved decorate their cars with characters from manga, anime or video games.
                        Itasha had its start in the 1980s but didn't gain much of a following until the 21st century
                        (Itasha, 2012, par. 1-3). Cosplay is a role-playing performance where the participants dress in
                        costume with accessories to depict an idea or a character. Popular sources of reference include
                        anime, manga, video games and comics but anything that can be understood theatrically may be used.
                        It is also given a generalized definition to include any form of costumed role-play aside from the
                        stage performances (Cosplay, 2012, par. 1-2). Kogal is a female fashion trend that requires wearing
                        a Japanese school uniform with a shortened skirt and loosened socks. Often a Kogal will have her hair
                        dyed and her skin tanned. The fad was popular in the 90's but has since seen its popularity drop
                        (Kogal, 2012, par. 1-2).

                        The Japanese use verbal and non-verbal communication to convey a message. Non-verbal types of
                        communications include facial expressions, posture and the tone of one's voice. Expressions such as
                        frowning would be interpreted as disagreement. It is also considered disrespectful to stare into someone
                        else's eyes (Kwintessential, n.d, &quot;Japanese Non-Verbal Communication&quot;). The eDiplomat website says
                        &quot;Nodding is very important. When listening to Japanese speak...you should nod to show you are listening
                        and understanding the speaker.&quot; The Japanese also have a concept called mentsu or &quot;face&quot; and the
                        Kwintessential website states &quot;Saving face is crucial in Japanese society&quot; and &quot;that turning down someone's
                        request causes embarrassment and loss of face to the other person&quot;. On the contrary, doing something to
                        build up a person around others can give face (Rochelle K., 2010, par. 2).
